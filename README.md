### Hi, I'm Quyet Tran Dang 👋

I'm an AI Engineer from Vietnam with **2+ years of hands-on experience** building and deploying end-to-end Machine Learning solutions. My core expertise lies in **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

I thrive on solving real-world business problems by transforming raw data into intelligent, automated systems. My approach is not just about building models, but about understanding the underlying challenges and architecting robust, efficient pipelines.
